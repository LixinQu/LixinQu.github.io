It is a broad, shallow shelf characterized by large inputs of fresh water from the Mississippi River. Submesoscale vortices within the river plume front are prevalent over the shelf in summertime, coexisting with strong NIWs generated by the land-sea breeze.\nThe figure below shows the ray tracing within an anti-cyclone over the shelf based on a realistic numerical simulation; it suggests that the enhanced mixing in the stratified interior is highly related to the downward radiation of NIWs and the consequent wave trapping within the anti-cyclone. Wave rays converge where the interior mixing is strongest, and the wave amplification can create strong shear to trigger instabilities, turbulence, and mixing. \n","date":1461733200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461733200,"objectID":"3aa9c1342f9a80d17b85591edf16e5e9","permalink":"https://LixinQu.github.io/research/niw/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/research/niw/","section":"research","summary":"Enhanced mixing caused by the trapping of near-inertial waves within submesoscale vortices.","tags":["Coastal Mixing"],"title":"Mixing by wave trapping","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Northern South China Sea Forecast System is a fully operational ocean circulation forecast model on the northern shelf of South China Sea based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).

That contrasts the classical quasi-geostrophic (QG) theory of buoyancy-driven flow over a sloping bottom that predicts unconditional instability growth \u0026ndash; the QG assumption may not be reasonable in submesoscale, energetic coastal fronts. We extend the classical non-geostrophic theory to the scenario with a sloping bottom; the adapted theory predicts the suppression of instabilities and indicates that the slope Burger number is the parameter controlling the suppression.\nThe figure below shows the comparisons between the numerical and theoretical growth rates based on QG theory and non-geostrophic theory (numerical growth rates are calculated based on a series of non-linear numerical simulations).
